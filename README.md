# MindSpore Skills

MindSpore development skills for AI coding agents. Route operator work, migrate models, and diagnose readiness, failure, accuracy, and performance issues with guided workflows.

Compatible with **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **Gemini CLI**, and **Codex**.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Register the marketplace and install:

```
/plugin marketplace add vigo999/mindspore-skills
/plugin install mscode@mindspore-skills
```

Then use slash command:

```
/mscode:migrate
/mscode:model-agent
/mscode:api-helper
/mscode:operator-agent
/mscode:readiness-agent
/mscode:accuracy-agent
/mscode:failure-agent
/mscode:algorithm-agent
/mscode:performance-agent
```

### OpenCode

Clone to your global config:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigo999/mindspore-skills.git ~/.config/opencode/mindspore-skills
ln -s ~/.config/opencode/mindspore-skills/skills ~/.config/opencode/skills
ln -s ~/.config/opencode/mindspore-skills/commands ~/.config/opencode/commands
```

Or for a specific project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigo999/mindspore-skills.git .opencode
```

Then in OpenCode:

```
/operator-agent
```

See [OpenCode Skills docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) for more details.

### Gemini CLI

Install as an extension:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/vigo999/mindspore-skills.git --consent
```

Or from local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigo999/mindspore-skills.git
gemini extensions install ./mindspore-skills --consent
```

See [Gemini CLI extensions docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/) for more details.

### Codex

Clone to your project root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigo999/mindspore-skills.git .mindspore-skills
```

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` automatically. Verify with:

```bash
codex "Summarize the MindSpore skills available."
```

See [Codex AGENTS guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md) for more details.

## Available Skills

### Operator Development

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `api-helper` | Find API call chains and operator wiring in MindSpore codebase |
| `operator-agent` | Route and build `torch` or `mindspore` operators through custom-access or native-framework integration, with MindSpore API-resolution and `op_info` verification support |

### Model Migration

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model-agent` | Top-level model migration entry that analyzes the source repo, selects the correct migration route, and verifies the result |

### Diagnosis and Optimization

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `accuracy-agent` | Diagnose accuracy regressions, drift, wrong results, and cross-platform mismatch after successful execution |
| `algorithm-agent` | Adapt a paper feature or released reference implementation into an existing model codebase, including specialized routes such as mHC integration, and prepare the patch for readiness validation |
| `readiness-agent` | Analyze a local single-machine training workspace and validate pre-run readiness before training |
| `failure-agent` | Diagnose MindSpore and PTA (torch_npu) training and runtime failures with evidence-backed root-cause validation |
| `performance-agent` | Diagnose throughput, latency, memory, utilization, dataloader, and communication bottlenecks after the workload already runs |

## Available Commands

### Operator Development

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/api-helper` | API chain discovery workflow |
| `/operator-agent` | Operator routing and implementation workflow with custom-access or native-framework integration |

### Model Migration

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/migrate` | Migration router (HF/third-party), routing only |
| `/model-agent` | Top-level model migration workflow with route selection and verification |

### Diagnosis and Optimization

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/accuracy-agent` | Accuracy diagnosis workflow after successful execution |
| `/algorithm-agent` | Algorithm feature adaptation workflow with patch generation, route-specific planning such as mHC, and readiness handoff |
| `/readiness-agent` | Single-machine training workspace readiness workflow |
| `/failure-agent` | Dual-stack failure diagnosis workflow with evidence, root-cause validation, and report output |
| `/performance-agent` | Performance diagnosis workflow with bottleneck validation and report output |

## Usage Examples

### Build an operator

```
/operator-agent

> Help me implement the linspace operator and choose the right integration path
```

### Examples

See `examples/README.md` for the current example inventory and status.

Additional example:

```
/algorithm-agent

> Add manifold-constrained hyper-connections (mHC) to this llm model and keep the non-mHC path unchanged
```
